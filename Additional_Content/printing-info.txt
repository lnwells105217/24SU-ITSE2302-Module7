Direct to Garmet
An inkjet printer is used to print the artwork onto the shirt. This technique is ideal for complex designs or photos. 
DTG prints will fade over time, but they are fast and cheap to produce. 
DTG be used with 100% cotton t-shirts or blends, and light-colored fabrics.

Direct to Film
A special PET film transfers designs to fabric with adhesive powder and heat. A shiny finish is left from the powder, 
but DTF produces very vibrant prints. DTF can be used on any color fabric, and on most types of material. 
It lasts longer than DTG prints, but is more expensive to produce.

Screen Printing
Ink is applied onto a t-shirt using a mesh screen stencil. This method creates fade-resistant prints because the inks are thicker than DTG, and seep into the fabric's fibers. It is best suited for simple designs with fewer colors. Screen printing can be used on most materials, including polyester.
This method has a high initial setup cost, and is not suited for small orders.
